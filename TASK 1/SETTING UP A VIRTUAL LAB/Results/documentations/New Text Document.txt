After i successfully set up the virtual lab, the two virtual machine communicated with each other 

by pinging each of the static ID that i asigned to each of them
so for you to ping that of the kali, you login unto the windows virtual machine and do so, and for you to ping windows 
you login into that of kali and ping the IP of the windows.
